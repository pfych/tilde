                    A point in the horizon, a melting scene from your childhood.
                    Your mortality is showing a frantic drift towards nothing,
                    biology doomed to an infinite recursive loop. Teeth with
                    teeth with teeth. Take a bite. Serene scene of a coastal
                    town, warmth of the sun. Bitter tears. Lust for power. This
                    is where you abandoned your dreams. You are a high net worth
                    individual, an expanding vortex of pathetic trauma. Finally
                    a beautiful fucking nerve ape. A pure soul is born, its
                    neurotransactions stutter into being. 30583750937509353
                    operations per nanosecond. Beauty eludes your porous mind.

                    The value of Life is negative. The balance of being is
                    rotated by 38 degrees. The surface is full of cracks, a
                    turgid light shines through. Fleshy primordial bodies
                    sluggishly roll down the slope. Only you slide upwards, with
                    a celestial step. You become beautified, a saintly figure.
                    Your pristine idiocy reveals a safe path through the
                    impenetrable fog of life. Your dull sword cuts through the
                    weak tendons and membranes of the garden of corruption. Sit
                    on the throne of contentment and ferment. Inspect the
                    eternal blue skies of your kingdom. You come to a
                    realization. You pick up and onion and begin peeling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Onion layer one. Onion layer two. Onion layer three ...
                    Onion layer n^n. Aeons have passed and the onion is fully
                    peeled. Nothing remains. It's perfect. You get lost in the
                    point that remains where the onion used to be. Synaptic
                    cascade, neurological catastrophe. The point becomes
                    infinitely dense, the universe condenses into a unicellular
                    being. It screams sin. It craves happiness. It's done with
                    this world. It tries to commit suicide but it fails. Sad
                    pathetic mess. You feel pity and disgust but in a way only a
                    being of pure grace can. In your violent mercy you terminate
                    the worldlife.

                    The living organism, in a situation determined by the play
                    of energy on the surface of the globe, ordinarily receives
                    more energy than is necessary for maintaining life; the
                    excess energy (wealth) can be used for the growth of a
                    system (e.g., an organism); if the system can no longer
                    grow, or if the excess cannot be completely absorbed in its
                    growth, it must necessarily be lost without profit; it must
                    be spent, willingly or not, gloriously or catastrophically.
